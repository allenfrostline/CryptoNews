# Hybrid Sentiment-Momentum Strategy in Cryptocurrency Market

This is an exploratory research trying to implement a simple yet robust sentiment analysis mechanism in the cryptocurrency market. We call it a hybrid sentiment-momentum strategy as it applies context analysis (or more specifically, word analysis) into traditional momentum strategies and adjusts position automatically over time using both factors. The hybrid strategy yields a remarkable Sharpe ratio of 2.68 with acceptable maximum drawdown in out-of-sample backtest, which is a huge improvement from classical momentum strategies in our analysis.
